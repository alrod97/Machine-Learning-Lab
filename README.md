# Machine-Learning-Lab
Machine Learning Lab (SoSe20 TU Berlin) course programming tasks.

All methods were implemented from scratch using NumPy and applied to different data sets.
Whenever possible, matrix-vector calculations are vectorized for an efficient computation.


COVERED:

1. Sheet 1: PCA, Outlier Detection, LLE

2. Sheet 2: Clustering, Expectation-Maximization

3. Sheet 3: Kernel Ridge Regression, Cross-Validation

4. Sheet 4: Support Vector Machines, Neural Networks

The respective reports with all our results are attached as a pdf in each problem task folder.
